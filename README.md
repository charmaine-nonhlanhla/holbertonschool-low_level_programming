# Holberton School Low Level Programming

Welcome to the Holberton School Low Level Programming repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises focused on low-level programming concepts in the C programming language.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a series of projects and assignments that cover fundamental concepts in low-level programming, including:

- Basic syntax and data types in C
- Memory management and manipulation
- Pointers, arrays, and strings
- File I/O and system calls
- Algorithms and data structures

Each project is designed to reinforce key concepts and build practical programming skills through hands-on coding exercises.
